#Student Management System

##Introduction

This is my first full-stack application that was built in 2 days using various technologies such as Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, SQL, React, Hibernate, and JPA. This project is an individual project, and its aim is to create a student management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

##Technologies Used

Java: Java is a high-level programming language used to build robust and scalable applications.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages and enhancing the user experience.

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a Java-based framework for building microservices and web applications. It makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade applications that you can "just run".

SQL: SQL is the standard language for managing relational databases.

React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient updates and rendering of components when the state changes.

Hibernate: Hibernate is an object-relational mapping tool that allows Java developers to work with relational databases using Java objects.

JPA: Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database.

##Student Management System

The student management system is a web application that provides a platform for managing student information. It includes basic CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete student records. This application was built using Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, SQL, React, Hibernate, and JPA.

The user interface was built using React, which allows for efficient updates and rendering of components when the state changes. The back-end was built using Java and Spring Boot, which makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade applications. The data is stored in a relational database and managed using SQL. Hibernate and JPA were used to map Java objects to the relational database and make it easy to access and manage the data.
